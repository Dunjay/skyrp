# SkyRP Server Manager

Desktop control panel that replaces the deploy `.bat` scripts. Runs on the
server box. **Run it as Administrator** — service control (nssm) needs it.

```bash
cd server-manager
setup.bat             # robust install — installs deps then launches the app
Run.bat               # everyday launch (self-elevates for service control)
npm run build:win     # packaged installer -> ../build/server-manager
```

`setup.bat` installs dependencies and then starts the manager via `Run.bat`.
After the first setup, just use `Run.bat` (it requests Administrator rights so
the Console tab can start/stop the Windows services).

If `npm start` reports *"Electron failed to install correctly"*, run `setup.bat`.
It recovers the Electron runtime even on a flaky firewall by, in order:
reusing the launcher's Electron (same version), extracting a zip you dropped in
manually, then retrying the download. If all else fails it prints a direct
download URL — save that zip as `server-manager\electron-v41.2.0-win32-x64.zip`
and re-run `setup.bat` to install it with no further download.

## Tabs

- **Console** — Start / Stop / Restart the nssm services (`SkyrpNginx`,
  `SkyrpBackend`, `SkyrpGameServer`), a live tail of the game/backend logs, and
  a command box. Commands go to the gamemode over the WS relay; their output
  shows up in the log tail.
- **Launcher** — edit the launcher version (writes `skymp5-launcher/package.json`
  and `LATEST_VERSION` in `skymp5-backend/routes/version.js`) and rebuild
  (clears `build/launcher`, rebuilds, names the installer
  `SkyrimRoleplayLauncher.exe`).
- **Modlist** — read the reference MO2 profile (mods / separators / plugins)
  and **Update manifest** (runs `compile-manifest.js`).
- **Client** — edit the client version (writes `skymp5-client/package.json` and
  `CLIENT_VERSION` in the backend `.env`), **Update client** (build plugin →
  build front-end → build client → native SkyrimPlatform DLLs, into
  `build/dist/client`), and a whitelist player list; click a player for their
  Discord / faction / character details.
- **Server** — **Build server** recompiles the game-server TS bundle (`build-ts`)
  and the native addon (`scam_native.node`) into `build/dist/server`. It does
  **not** restart the service — use the Console tab. The native addon is skipped
  while the server is running (the file is locked); stop it first to rebuild it.
- **Settings** — reserved for later.

### Native builds (.dll / .node)

The Client and Server build buttons now also compile the native C++ via CMake.
The first native build **configures** the CMake build dir; after that it just
runs `cmake --build`, overwriting the old binaries in `build/dist`. This needs a
working C++ toolchain (MSVC Build Tools) and a **bootstrapped `vcpkg`** in the
repo. The first configure pulls/builds vcpkg deps (CEF, CommonLibSSE-NG) — point
vcpkg at the project's NuGet binary cache so they download instead of compile,
or expect a long first run. Subsequent native builds are incremental (minutes).

## Configuration (environment variables)

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `SKYRP_LOG_DIR` | `C:\logs` | nssm log directory to tail |
| `SKYRP_MO2_ROOT` | `C:\MO2` | reference MO2 install (Modlist tab) |
| `SKYRP_GAME_ROOT` | `C:\GOG Games\Skyrim Anniversary Edition` | game root for root-file capture |
| `SKYRP_MO2_PROFILE` | `Default` | MO2 profile to compile |
| `SKYRP_BUILD_DIR` | `<repo>\build` | CMake build dir; native output lands in its `dist/` |
| `SKYRP_SKIP_NATIVE` | *(unset)* | Set to `1` to skip native (.dll/.node) builds |
| `SKYRP_CMAKE` | *(auto)* | Path to `cmake.exe` (auto-detected: PATH → standalone → VS-bundled) |
| `SKYRP_CMAKE_CONFIGURE_ARGS` | *(none)* | Extra flags for the first `cmake` configure |

The repo path, service names, and the WS relay port/secret (from the backend
`.env`) are detected automatically.

## Remaining wiring

The Console command box delivers commands to the gamemode via a new `console`
role on the WS relay (`skymp5-backend/sources/wsRelay.js`). The gamemode still
needs a handler for `{ type: 'console_command', text }` (in
`skymp5-functions-lib`) to actually execute them — until then commands are
accepted and forwarded but not run.
